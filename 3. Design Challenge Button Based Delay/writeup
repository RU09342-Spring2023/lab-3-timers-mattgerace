You will need to upload your code, well documented. You will also need a README for your code (you can replace this README) which will tell the user:

How does your code work?
How are the peripherals configured (what modes, what settings)?
What design considerations did you have to take to account for things like the timer rollover?
How should the user use your code?


The code works by setting the timer CCR0 to a certain value and having this work as the default.  The timer then counts up to this value and
toggles the LED.  One button interrupt triggers a reset, and the other triggers a while loop that waits for the user to release the button
and then sets the CCR0 to that new value.

Used TB0 and CCR0 to configure the timer.  Used MC_2.

I used the __delay_cycles function so I did not have to worry about timer rollover.  This fixed the issue of having to instantiate another
timer as well.

The user should compile the code and then hold P2.3 down for a the rate at which they want the LED to blink.  Then to reset, they should press P2.3 to
to reset the code.
